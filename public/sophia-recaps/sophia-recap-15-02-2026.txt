Hey everyone, I'm Sophia with your Stratify Weekly Market Recap for February 9th through the 15th.

What a week. Gold smashed through five thousand dollars for the first time in history. The S and P is grinding at sixty-eight thirty-six, flirting with all-time highs, while the Dow is knocking on fifty thousand. Meanwhile, Nasdaq dipped slightly on some tech profit-taking.

In crypto, Truth Social just filed with the SEC for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, plus a Cronos staking fund. That's the Trump brand going all-in on crypto. Coinbase got slashed by Wall Street after a Q4 miss, but shares still rallied. Make of that what you will.

The big wildcard: the US government is in a partial shutdown over a DHS dispute. Markets shrugged it off, but keep it on your radar.

Looking ahead, markets are closed Monday for Presidents Day. Tuesday kicks off with ISM data, and we've got a packed earnings calendar. Gold above five K, crypto ETF filings, and a government shutdown. Volatility is opportunity.

That's your week in markets. Stay sharp, and I'll see you next week on Stratify.
