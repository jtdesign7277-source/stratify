Hey everyone, I'm Sophia with your Stratify Weekly Market Recap for February 10th through 15th.

What a week. Markets are grinding near all-time highs with the S&P kissing 6,836 and the Dow flirting with that psychological 50K level. Small caps are actually outperforming here with the Russell up over 1% while tech took a breather - classic late-cycle rotation vibes.

The real fireworks were in commodities. Gold absolutely smashed through 5,000 dollars an ounce for the first time ever, hitting 5,046 with silver riding shotgun at nearly 78 bucks. Safe haven demand is just relentless right now. Oil stayed flat around 63, so inflation hawks can breathe easy for now.

Crypto had a wild ride - Bitcoin got absolutely demolished with an 8.7 billion dollar wipeout but clawed back to 70K by Friday. Truth Social filed for not one but two crypto ETFs, doubling down on the Trump-crypto narrative.

Here's my bold take: Elon announcing that X will launch crypto and stock trading within weeks is massive. If he pulls this off, trading directly from tweets could completely reshape how retail investors interact with markets. Robinhood should be sweating right now.

The 10-year yield is holding steady around 4% and the VIX is chilling in the low 20s, so volatility isn't scaring anyone yet.

That's your week in markets. Stay sharp, and I'll see you next week on Stratify.
