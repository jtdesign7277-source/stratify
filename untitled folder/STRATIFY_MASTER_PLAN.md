# 🚀 STRATIFY MASTER PLAN
## The World's Best Prediction Market Arbitrage Scanner

---

# ⚡ WHAT STRATIFY DOES

### Core Product
- **Cross-platform arbitrage scanner** for prediction markets (Kalshi, Polymarket, sportsbooks)
- Finds the **SAME BET with DIFFERENT ODDS** across platforms
- **One-click dual bet slip** execution with edge/profit calculated automatically
- Example: Celtics -150 on Kalshi vs -160 on Polymarket → sell -160, buy -150 → **FREE MONEY**

### 🧠 Atlas AI (THE SECRET SAUCE)
- **Chat interface** to create custom scanning strategies
- Users describe what they want → Atlas builds it
- **Backtest strategies** before deploying
- **Multiple scanners** can run simultaneously
- **Auto-buy OR manual** execution - user's choice

### 🦋 LIVE IN-GAME ARBITRAGE (KILLER FEATURE)
- Exploits **volatile live betting lines**
- Lines swing wildly during games → opportunities everywhere
- **Butterfly strategy positioning:**
  1. Open position at Celtics -150
  2. Other team scores → line drops to even money
  3. Take other side on different platform
  4. Line reverses → open 3rd position
  5. **GUARANTEED PROFIT regardless of outcome**
- Cross-platform live discrepancies: +2000 on Site A vs +2200 on Site B
- One-click both → **instant locked profit**
- **Speed + visibility = edge** (retail can't do this manually fast enough)
